title: What's a .WBL file?
draft: false

> The Workbench load file (WBL) is used by the Mashup editor and lists the name of all files included in the mashup project. When you save a mashup project from the Mashup editor, a WBL file is automatically included in the project.

Note: This file is not necessary for using a visualization extension, just in case you have added some files to Workbench and you want to edit those files in Workbench.
